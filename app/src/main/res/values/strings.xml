	<string name="aboutText">PasswordFactory is a simple app for generating multiple passwords at a time based on custom settings you can modify in its preferences. You can generate until you see a password you like. If you long press on a password, it will be copied to your clipboard to paste into your favorite password vault app (this application does not store any passwords). \n\nThis software is being released under the Apache License 2.0. The source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/brickman/PasswordFactory">https://github.com/brickman/PasswordFactory</a>. I may make minor updates as I find needs for them, but I also would be happy to add features via pull requests. If you are not a developer but seek any additional features, feel free to contact me with feedback. I don\'t make any promises, but based on complexity, I might add other requested features.</string>
